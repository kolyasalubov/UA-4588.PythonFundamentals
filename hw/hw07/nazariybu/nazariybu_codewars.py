# Task I
# Jenny's secret message
# Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user.
#  However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different.
# She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.
# Can you help her?

# def greet(name):

# Task II.
# Find The Distance Between Two Points

# def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
#     x = (x2 - x1) ** 2 
#     y = (y2 - y1) ** 2

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Task III. 
# No yelling!
# Write a function taking in a string 
# like WOW this is REALLY          amazing and returning Wow this is really amazing. 
# String should be capitalized and properly spaced. Using re and string is not allowed.

# def filter_words(st):
#    st = st.capitalize()
#    st = " ".join(st.split())
#    return st

# print(filter_words('This    will    not    pass '))
# print(filter_words('HELLO world!'))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task IV.
# Convert a Number to a String
# We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

# def number_to_string(num):
#     return str(num)

# print(number_to_string(123))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task V.
# Reversing Words in a String
# You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string.
# Words are always separated by a single space.
# As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

# def reverse(st):
#     st = st.split()
#     st = ' '.join(st[::-1])
#     return st


# print(reverse("Hello World"))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task VI. 
# Reverse List Order
# In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

# def reverse_list(l):
#     return l[::-1]

# print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task VII.
# Multiples of 3 or 5
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
# The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
# Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

# def solution(number):
#     number = list(range(number))
#     suma = 0
#     for i in number:
#         if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
#             suma += i
#     return suma        

# print(solution(10))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task VIII.
# Will you make it?
# You were camping with your friends far away from home,
# but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away!
# You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.
# Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.
# Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.

# def zero_fuel(distance_to_pump, mpg, fuel_left):
#     if distance_to_pump / mpg <= fuel_left:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False

# print(zero_fuel(56,25,2))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task IX.
# Are You Playing Banjo?
# Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
# If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
# The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
# name + " plays banjo" 
# name + " does not play banjo"

# def are_you_playing_banjo(name):
#     if name[0].lower() == "r":
#         name = " ".join([name, 'plays banjo'])
#     else:
#         name = " ".join([name, 'does not play banjo'])
#     return name

# print(are_you_playing_banjo("Richard"))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task X. 
# Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'Noâ€™
# Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

# def bool_to_word(boolean):
#     if boolean:
#         return "Yes"
#     else:
#         return "No"

# print(bool_to_word(False))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task XI. 
# Counting sheep
# Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place.
# We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

# def count_sheeps(sheep):
#     return sheep.count(True)

# print(count_sheeps(
# [True,  True,  True,  False,
#   True,  True,  True,  True ,
#   True,  False, True,  False,
#   True,  False, False, True ,
#   True,  True,  True,  True ,
#   False, False, True,  True]))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Task XII.
# Is this my tail?
# Some new animals have arrived at the zoo.
# The zoo keeper is concerned that perhaps the animals do not have the right tails.
# To help her, you must correct the broken function to make sure that the second argument (tail),
# is the same as the last letter of the first argument (body) - otherwise the tail wouldn't fit!
# If the tail is right return true, else return false.
# The arguments will always be non empty strings, and normal letters.

# def correct_tail(body, tail):
#     sub = body[-len(tail):]
#     if sub == tail:
#         return True
#     return False

# print(correct_tail("Fox", "x"))
